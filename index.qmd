Hi! I am an experimental Eco-Physiologist, recently having completed and defended my PhD, "Growth and metabolic scaling of fish" at DTU Aqua in Lyngby, Denmark. Being a experimental Eco-Physiologist means that I conduct experiments to find out how animals are adapted to there environment and how they respond to changes. I then use quantitative data analysis to examine how my and others data can help explain ecological reposes.

My research has mainly focused on:

-   Whole body animal energetic (determining minimum and maximum energy use and thus energetic budget)
-   How metabolic rate scales with body size (see short video about what scaling is)
-   Trade-offs between growth rate and energy use
-   Impact of anthropocentric changes on metabolic rate in tropical and arctic environments
-   Measurement of protein synthesis following meal ingestion

When I am not in the lab running respiratory on fish or collecting copepods in Greenland, I like to play board games with friends or be out in nature. In fact, I am equally ecstatic sitting in my tent in a remote mountain valley in northern Sweden by myself as I am playing hour-long board games with my buddies, though in both cases I will be enjoying a good cup of tea. When I am doing neither of these things, I enjoy cooking food, with a particular fondness for making Danish ryebread, and reading lengthy fantasy books.
